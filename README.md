ABSTRACT :-

Business Meeting summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a meeting (or sources) to produce an abridged version for a particular user (or users) and task (or tasks).
The ideal of automatic summarization work is to develop techniques by which a machine can generate summarizations that successfully imitate summaries generated by human beings.
So, Summarization involves extracting the most meaningful and valuable bits of information from conversations, audio/video files, etc., briefly and concisely. It is generally done by feature capturing the statistical, linguistic, and sentimental traits with the dialogue structure of the conversation in question.
In this project, we will be using deep learning and natural language processing techniques to create precise summaries of business meetings while upholding the context of the entire conversation.
